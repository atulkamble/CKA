## Install Latest VirtualBox

> Note: You should have admin permission in your workstation to make Virtaualbox work.

Download and install virtual box from https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

Create/edit the /etc/vbox/networks.conf file and add the following to avoid any network-related issues.

```
* 0.0.0.0/0 ::/0
or run below commands

sudo mkdir -p /etc/vbox/
echo "* 0.0.0.0/0 ::/0" | sudo tee -a /etc/vbox/networks.conf
```

So that the host only networks can be in any range, not just 192.168.56.0/21 as described here: https://discuss.hashicorp.com/t/vagrant-2-2-18-osx-11-6-cannot-create-private-network/30984/23
